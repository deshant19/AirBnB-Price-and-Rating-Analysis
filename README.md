# AirBnB-Price-and-Rating-Analysis

## Overview of the company and report objectives

AirBnB Inc. (AirBnB) is an American company operating an online marketplace for lodging:
primarily vacation rentals and tourism activities. The company was founded in 2007 by Brian
Chesky, Nathan Blecharczyk, and Joe Gebbia in San Francisco, California. Since then, it has
experienced extremely rapid growth all over the world and currently has 4+ million hosts,
6+ million listings, and over a billion guest arrivals all time (AirBnB, 2022a). The success of
AirBnB is largely due to its unique business model that is focused on providing its users an
open platform, free market, and affordability. AirBnB continues to disrupt the lodging industry,
and as the number of travellers is bound to steadily increase post the COVID-19 pandemic, the
company is likely to keep growing.
The purpose of this report is to explore an AirBnB dataset with a focus on 2 crucial variables:
price of a listing and rating of the host. More specifically, the prices and ratings in the United
States (US). The motivation behind this was the undeniable importance of the variables to the
host and the tenant. The price of a listing and the rating of the host are likely the first 2
things an individual considers when choosing their place of stay. Furthermore, as with most
online marketplaces, the listing with the highest rating and ”best” price is usually one of the first
options visible to the user (i.e. first result to show up from a search). The goal of the report
is to provide meaningful and useful insights surrounding prices and ratings for all current and
potential users of AirBnB.

## Methodology

#### Guiding questions

The report is structured around answering 3 primary questions and their relevant sub-questions:
1. Do ”super-hosts” have substantially higher ratings on average compared to non-superhosts?
2. What are the top 10 most expensive states in the US?

(a) What are the most expensive neighborhoods in each of the top 10 expensive states?
(b) What is the average price for different room types in the neighborhoods?

3. Predictive Analytics: How well can the provided independent variables predict the price
of a listing?

(a) Does additive model, interaction term model or transformed model perform better?
(b) Are all key assumptions for linear regression met?

As previously mentioned, the objective of the report is to provide useful information surrounding
the prices and ratings of the listings in the US. The analysis of the first question provides insights
on how much ratings affect whether a host is labeled a ”super-host” or not. The second question
provides useful information for travellers in terms of the different price expectations in different
states, neighborhoods, and room types. Lastly, a regression analysis is performed to predict the
price of a listing, highlighting the key variables that influence the price of a listing.
